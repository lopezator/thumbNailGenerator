thumbNailGenerator
==================

A thumbnail working generator example. Practical use of PHP Design patterns.

Works by itself, you only have to specificy a couple urls containing an image, and execute the file testIt.php via browser or console. If you have write rights, it will create a thumbnails folder and put some thumbnails into it. Feel free to modify/fork/extend suggest changes and improvements.

Any doubts:

Note:

The code contains the phpThumb library inside the /lib folder. I don't own this library.

It used to be hosted at: http://phpthumb.gxdlabs.com (now broken).
